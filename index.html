									<div class="content">
										<h2 class="major">html, css and javascript</h2>
										<p>Strong knowledge of front-end development tools. Experience using html, css, javascript and jquerry while working as a website coordinator for ajet.net. I've logged countless hours coding my own projects as well as participating in hack-a-thons.</p>

										<h2 class="major">React</h2>
										<p>Extensive experience developing within the React ecosystem while using Redux for state management. My confidence allows me to troubleshoot and debug my colleagues' code. Problem-solving is what attracted me to development and analyzing and debugging code is like a puzzle that needs to be solved. I am passionate about React development and I think it shows in my work. If you can imagine it, I can build it.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Node.js and Java</h2>
										<p>Full-stack javascript development makes your team versatile. I specialize in Node.js utilizing Express for native and server/api development. I studdied Java at university and have continued my education autodidactically since then. I've utilized my Java coding skills in Japan by making numerous apps and games that were used by my colleagues to aid in instruction of foreign language to children of all ages (from kindergarten up to high school). I think my unique experience can make me a valuable member of your full-stack team.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Recent Projects</h2>
									<p>I started coding in the early 2000s but since then, I've continued to hone my skills by making pragrams and apps for problems I face in my day-to-day and professional life. I've made a deliberate effort to continue my education and practice my skills. I also code for fun.</p>

											<h3 class="major">The Queue</h3>
											<p>Students at Lambda School need a place where they can escalate their concers and recieve help. This application allows section leads and team leads to manage help desk tickets that come in from students. All users can submit a help desk ticket and categorize it. All users can also post helpful advice to tickets in the form of a comment. Section leads can assign themselves or a team lead to a ticket. Team leads can also assign themselves to a ticket.</p>
											<p>This was the first project of this magnitude that I built myself, front-end to back-end.</p>
											<p>I used Node with Express to build out the API. Knex with SQLite3 were used to build out the development and test environment. PostgreSQL was used in the production environment. To protect user information bcrypt and json web tokens were used. The application does not store the user's password! Testing was done with Jest and Supertest</p>
											<p>The front-end is built with React utilizing Redux for state management, React Router, and axios.</p>

											<h3 class="major">AirPrice</h3>
											<p>I led the front-end team in this cross-functional project. We worked with an international team of data science and machine learning engineers to develop an application to show the optimal price of an AirBnb listing in a given neighborhood in Berlin based on information provided by the user.
											</p>
											<p>As the front-end lead, I delegated tasks and supervised all git merges to the development and master branches. I implemented the application’s state management (Redux), communication with the back-end and DS models, and all business logic.

											<h3 class="major">Spider.Graph</h3>
											<p>I worked on a team of six engineers to deliver a proof-of-concept build backed by a venture capitalist. We built out the entire application in a week. The application allows the user to create dynamic radar graphs using an intuitive and responsive user interface.</p>
