									<h3 class="major">My journey so far</h3>
									<p>Hi! I am a full-stack web developer. I have a bachelors degree in music technology, but I also took computer science courses while at university, centered around Java programming. Since then, I've specialized in JavaScript. Most of my recent projects have been built using React, Redux for state management and Node for the back-end.</p>
									<p>I worked in Japan as a website coordinator with the Association for Japan Exchange and Teaching (AJET). AJET is a non-profit organization which serves foreign teachers in Japan. As a website coordinator, I worked mainly with WordPress, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and jQuery to manage content and build custom components and plugins. While working in Japan, I also built many applications centered around classroom instruction in Java. Working in Japan, I developed a strong work ethic that combined the productivity of the American worker with the dedication and endurance of the Japanese.</p>
									<p>Before I came back to the world of software engineering, I was an English teacher in Japan for four years. I taught at all levels, from kindergarten to high school. I also led seminars at universities. While attending the University of Central Missouri, I taught classical guitar to students of all ages in one on one lessons. I think my unique experience provides me with a strong synergy of technical know-how and practiced soft skills.</p>
									<p>Since then, I have returned to the USA and am refining my web development skills with Lambda School. As a student, I have been very active in the school help channel assisting my fellow students in debugging and troubleshooting their code and helping them understand the underlying cause of the errors or problems they post.</p>
									<p>I am eager to put my engineering skills to work. If you think I would be a good match for your team, feel free to reach out.</p>
